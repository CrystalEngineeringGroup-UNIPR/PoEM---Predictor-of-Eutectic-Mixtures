# PoEM-Predictor-of-Eutectic-Mixtures
PoEM is a free of charge software coded by Dr. Michele Prencipe (michele.prencipe[at]unipr.it) and Dr. Andrea Daolio (andrea.daolio[at]unipr.it) from the Crystal Engineering's group of the University of Parma (IT). This code is licenced under AFL-3.0.

PoEM (i.e. Predictor of Eutectic Mixtures) is a software able to calculate the eutectic point (temperature and molar fraction) of a real binary mixture considering the interaction parameter χ defined within the Regular solution theory, knowing the melting temperature and the enthalpy of fusion of the two components in their pure form. 
The software allows for a prediction of the eutectic points in two different ways.
- MULTI-TABLES mode: given a molecule of interest (defined by its melting point and enthalpy of fusion) it returns a 10x10 table of virtual binary mixtures defined by their eutectic point. 8 different tables are given as output for different values of χ (i.e. -4; -2; 0; +3)
- SINGLE-PLOT mode: given two molecular components (defined by their melting point and enthalpy of fusion) the software returns two superimposed plots of the binary mixture calculated in the ideal conditions (χ = 0) and not-ideal conditions (χ = user defined)

How to use "PoEM.exe":

"PoEM.exe" requires the following files in the same folder to be run:

- _internal
- Script_POEM.exe
- Logo_PoEM_tool.ico
- Logo_PoEM.png

Script_PoEM.exe works exactly as PoEM.exe, but does not show the starting graphic of PoEM (University of Parma).

WARINING: Do not rename files present in the folder!
